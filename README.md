# project-of-C

The Railway Reservation System project, proposed by Ashim Acharya, Nitesh Shahi, and Abiral, is a console-based software application developed using the C programming language. Designed as a practical assignment for their C programming course at Kingâ€™s College, the project aims to simulate a basic train ticket booking environment. The system enables users to check seat availability, book and cancel train tickets, and view a list of passengers, all through a simple command-line interface. It is built using arrays and structures to manage data such as seat numbers and passenger names, offering a hands-on learning experience in core C programming concepts.

The application targets an individual train of 100 positions, and its flow allows customers to communicate a menu to complete actions such as booking and cancelling. This interface is written on simple input/output functions this includes the printf and scanf which make the interface simple and user friendly without any graphics user interface ( GUI ). Although it is rather narrow in its scope, the design can be extended in future with such features as multiple trains, various classes (e.g. AC, sleeper), and database integration.

In a bid to achieve reliability, the system undergoes unit testing, integration testing and system testing. Issues such as input validation, memory management without database and crash freezing under user error are addressed and taken into consideration. The whole project is to be developed within one week and by a team of three people to work with free tools: Code::Blocks and GCC. The project can be easily accomplished with the relatively low expenses that are half in documentation and one-half in time.

Finally, Railway Reservation System is a great academic project which improves the programming skills and introduces real-life logic design, as well as teaches students to be more advanced in software development, working with theoretical knowledge in a practical, functioning environment.
